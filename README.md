# How to deploy this page

This portfolio requires Tailwind to the styles, I like to "compile" tailwind by just downloading the Standalone CLI [https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli](as here) and then running the next command

```powershell
.\tailwindcss-windows-x64.exe -i src\input.css -o src\output.css --watch
```

All without NodeJS
