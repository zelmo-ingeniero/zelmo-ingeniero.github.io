        tool is the most efficient with these small datasets.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-2">
        The integrity of the files is I expected, the most of registers inside
        each dataset are not clean, this is to say with
        <span class="font-bold">NULLs</span>
        and blanks or the text is not enough coherent
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        Therefore it's necessary use this phase to clean the data because there
        are errors inside the dataset. This is achieved with techniques like
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc w-10/12 mx-auto">
        <li class="pb-1">
          Filters to delete speedly the rows with blank cells

        <li class="pb-1">Formatting data types to convert text to numbers</li>
        <li class="pb-1">
          Formulas like
          <span class="font-mono">=LEFT( , )</span>
          to substract the numbers from ratings cells

        <li class="pb-1">Find & Replacing to remove extra characters</li>
        <li class="pb-1">
          Column renaming because the tables was different types of names and

      <p class="text-pretty pb-10">
        I worked individually the four dataset because they have not enough
        compatibility between columns being the only two common were the price
        and rating. Then I ordered descently by price in all

        This is the
        <span class="font-mono">AmazonPC</span>
        dataset and first I realize that some rows are accesories, delete all
        the accessories in the column name. Here not seems like there's a
        tendency between price and rating
      </p>
      <h2 class="pb-2 text-xl font-bold font-mono sm:w-10/12 sm:mx-auto">

          dataset in categories but they are eight
        </li>
        <li class="pb-2">
          Only filter categories one by one copying the 10 cheapest to another
          sheet making a table with eighty rows. Inside that new sheet sum the
          most cheapest components of all and the result is $ 114.88, not bad
        </li>
        <li class="pb-2">
          Afterly I used functions as
          <span class="inline-block font-mono">=IF( , )</span>
          and
          <span class="inline-block font-mono">=AVERAGE( )</span>
          to calculate the price average of each category, the result is: one
          common PC costs $1415.8 maybe ten times the cheapest

        <li class="pb-2">
          Here something strange happen, the visualizations had too many

          solved this making before <span class="font-bold">Pivot tables</span>

          I notice that laptop sizes often are similar whatever the processor
          capacity, while the processor price and capacity has a tendency or
          relation, I mean more price could be more laptop capacity

          processor, seems like the primebook are the most economic option
        </li>
        <li class="pb-2">
          I create a visualization between the price and the rating column
        </li>
        <li class="pb-2">
          Here i will compare again processor and prices to confirm the tendency
          but there is an issue, in the data there are different generations for
          each processor model and I guess that this is not necessary in this
          project
        </li>
        <li class="pb-2">
          Again use a pivot table and then i collapse various generation models
          to only one model manually
        </li>
        <li class="pb-2">
          Then I make three different pivot tables to compare:
          <span class="inline-block font-mono">rating VS number_of_rating</span>,
          <span class="inline-block font-mono">rating VS number_of_reviews</span> and so on.
          now it's not necessary to collapse the processor generations
        </li>
        <li class="pb-2">
          To finish i make the expected price and rating visualization where the
          result was awesome for me
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="pb-2">
        Until now are here some new answers to the questions in the asking
        phase. The themes that I am exploring are PC hardware which include
        peripherals that were removed. Also, I know how coexist different CPUs
        in the market, what are more similar and compatibles
      </p>
      <p class="pb-2">
        Now we have an insight from each individual dataset, is a good idea do a
        review about all this information before to share all with others

          Then to obtain processor visualizations was needed to group the

          In this dataset there is more detailed information about the ratings
          and is really interesting to me this data in this project to confirm
          if the lower rating correspond to the computers that we are looking
          for
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption class="pb-4">
          We can notice that the unique relation is between number of reviews
          and number of ratings, something that is not enough help. At least
          know that lower prices doesn't equals to bad products

          To finish I wanna see how the processor are rated by their capacity

          Even althought there is some with very low capacity, in general the
          rating is uniform to all of them, therefore there is PCs which has
          good rating, good price and good potential, seems a better idea to
          choose a laptop

          There is not tendency between the PC quality and its price (according

          The PC's price is approximated to its processor capacity, altought you
          can find very good options at low cost (according to Curry dataset)

          There is not relation between processor capacity or the Laptop size

        This is the last phase in the data analysis process where the insights
        and conclutions move to the real world. All was done to make logical
        changes that represent an improvement in the company. As this is a
        personal project
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        Soon, to achieve a deeper and further data analysis I recomend to
        continue with:

          Put more details about the data origin and try to find some type of

        What I learned
      </h1>
      <p class="pb-2">
        I almost had not knowledges about the Data analysis field that is so
        widely mentioned in different contexts, as programmer think that this is
        a job oportunity because is a few similar in the structured thinking and
        in the tools to carry out the process
      </p>
      <p class="pb-20">
        I liked the data analysis process and enjoyed make this project
