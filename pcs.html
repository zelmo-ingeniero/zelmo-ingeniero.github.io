        The client is a Finance company, to work they use diverse computers

        You need to be careful selecting the computer, should be cheap, with

        At this part I make some questions principally for myself to

        Process and cleaning data

    <p class="readable paragraph">
        Firstly I choose Microsoft Excel to do this project because the 
        four datasets has the <span class="font-code bold">.CSV</span> format
    </p>
    <p class="readable paragraph">
        The integrity of the files is I expected, the most of registers 
        inside each dataset are not clean, this is to say with 
        <span class="font-code bold">NULLs</span>
        and blanks or the text is not enough coherent
    </p>
    <p class="readable paragraph">
        Therefore it's necessary use this phase to clean the data because 
        there are errors inside the dataset. This is achieved with techniques 
        like
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="readable">
            Filters to delete speedly the rows with blank cells
        </li>
        <li class="readable">
            Formatting to convert text to numbers
        </li>
        <li class="readable">
            Formulas like
            <span class="font-code">=LEFT( , )</span>
            to substract the numbers from ratings cells
        </li>
        <li class="readable">Find & Replacing</li>
        <li class="readable">
            Column renaming because the tables was different types of names 
            and the standard is all <b>lowercase</b> separated by underscores

    <h1 class="title-green">
        Analyze phase
    </h1>
    <p class="readable paragraph">
        I worked individually the four dataset because they have not enough 
        compatibility between columns being the only two common were the 
        price and rating. Then I ordered descently by price in all
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle2">Dataset 1</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            This is the 
            <span class="font-code">AmazonPC</span>
            dataset and first I realize that some rows 
            are accesories, delete all the accessories in the column name.
            Here not seems like there's a tendency between price and rating
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle2">Dataset 2</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            This is the 
            <span class="font-code">Components</span> 
            dataset and here there are categories, 
            I would like me to divide the dataset in categories but they 
            are eight
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            Only filter categories one by one copying the 10 cheapest 
            to another sheet making a table with eighty rows. Inside 
            that new sheet sum the most cheapest components of all and 
            the result is $ 114.88, not bad
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            Afterly I used functions as
            <span class="font-code">=IF( , )</span>
            and
            <span class="font-code">=AVERAGE(  )</span>
            to calculate the price average of each category, the result 
            is: one common PC costs $ 1415.8 maybe ten times 
            the cheapest
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            Then I make one visualization with the component price 
            and component rating column
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle2">Dataset 3</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            This is the 
            <span class="font-code">Curry</span> 
            dataset where the data is almost completely 
            clean and just now is visible that the best prices are in the 
            Lenovo Pads
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            Here something strange happen, the visualizations had too 
            many horizontal values as if there was more dimentions in 
            the data. I solved this making before <b>Pivot tables</b> 
            in a new sheet, a pivot table for processor capacities and 
            laptop sizes also for prices
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            I notice that laptop sizes often are similar whatever the 
            processor capacity, while the processor price and capacity 
            has a tendency or relation, I mean more price could be more 
            laptop capacity
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle2">Dataset 4</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            This is the 
            <span class="font-code">Laptop League</span>
            dataset and delete the word "Processor: " 
            in the cell's column processor, seems like the primebook are 
            the most economic option
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            I create a visualization between the price and the rating column
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            Here i will compare again processor and prices to confirm the 
            tendency but there is an issue, in the data there are 
            different generations for each processor model and I guess that 
            this is not necessary in this project
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            Again use a pivot table and then i collapse various generation 
            models to only one model manually
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            Then I make three different pivot tables to compare: 
            <span class="font-code">rating VS number_of_rating</span>,
            <span class="font-code">rating VS number_of_reviews</span> and 
            so on. now it's not necessary to collapse the processor 
            generations
        </li>
        <li class="readable paragraph">
            To finish i make the expected price and rating visualization 
            where the result was awesome for me
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="readable paragraph">
        Now we have an insight from each individual dataset, is a good idea 
        do a reflection about all this information before to share all with
